## // Back-End Developer

<p> Pleasure!
My name is Luis Felipe, I'm a software developer, having experience with Ruby on Rails, TDD/Rspec, Bootstrap, JQuery, PostgreSQL, AWS, P.O.O, Docker. Also, I really like working in a team.
I know the basics of ReactJs and Typescript (I'm very good at learning new technologies when needed). I currently work as a backend software engineer at SmartFit </p>
